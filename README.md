# Puzzle Game
This is a website featuring a puzzle cards game. The game consists of a set of cards that are initially hidden, and the player's goal is to match every two cards together by clicking on them. If the two selected cards are a match, they will remain visible; otherwise, they will shift back to their original position. The game continues until the player matches all the cards.

## Features
The game is played on the website itself, with the cards displayed on the screen. The game includes a counter that keeps track of the number of moves the player makes.

At the beginning of the game, a pop-up window asks the player to enter their name. The name is then displayed at the top of the screen, along with the timer and moves counter.

## Usage
To play the game, the user simply clicks on a card to reveal its hidden image. They can then click on a second card to reveal its image. If the two cards match, they will remain visible; otherwise, they will shift back to their original position. The game continues until the player matches all the cards.

User can also enter their name at the beginning of the game, and the timer and moves counter will keep track of their progress.
